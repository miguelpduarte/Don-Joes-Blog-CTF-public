I've been working on a new tool: Passive Word Detector!

This tool is something that I, the best software developer ever, is developing to passively detect words that are used more frequently when communicating.
If you use some words too many times, it will let you know so that you can have a more varied vocabulary!

In truth, that is basically it. This is not an extremely complex project, but I wanted to focus on a simpler endeavour for once, given how my projects are usually super awesome!
