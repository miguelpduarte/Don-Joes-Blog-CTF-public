On this blogpost I'll go over something that is frequently troublesome: Cracking!

In sum, "Don't Crack This!", my up and coming book (which will certainly be a masterpiece) goes into some detail about subtle codes that even I sometimes use.
As a master of the art of programming I indeed enjoy leaving some references in my software.

These, much like other things one finds, are not meant to be cracked but instead enjoyed and used in their natural state! They are much more helpful and amusing like so!
