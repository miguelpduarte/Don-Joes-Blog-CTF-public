- structure: templates, static?
- index page
- blog page - ensure LFI and test for passwd -> filter for "flag" in arg name and say "nono"
- blog posts, check Trello

Pt 2:
- hash the passwords, store the originals in README.md or something that is not inside the folder that gets uploaded.
- hidden login page
- admin page that checks if you're admin and has the flag

Pt 3:
- Make the zip and serve it
- Confirm that docker is working
- Deploy to heroku using docker
----- above done -----

Pt 4:
- after checking that everything is working, make the templates prettier
- Dockerfile and flag.py are different in the source.zip, so we should take care of how those files are when deploying them
